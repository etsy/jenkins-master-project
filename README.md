Jenkins Plugin: Master Project
==============================

This is a plugin for [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org) Continuous Integration Server.  This plugin provides a new project type.  In this new project type you can select a list of sub-projects which should be executed in one logical master project.

Installation
---------------------------

Install Maven 2.2.1 or higher

    cd ~/jenkins-master-project
    mvn package && mvn install
    scp target/master-plugin.hpi user@jenkins.server:/opt/jenkins/.jenkins/plugins/.

The last part is to place the `hpi` file into the plugins directory.  You can also do this through the Jenkins interface if you do not have `ssh` access to the Jenkins server.

Adding Jobs via Regular Expression
---------------------------

You can add a job via regular expression.  This works just like the Jenkins List View's regular expression.
